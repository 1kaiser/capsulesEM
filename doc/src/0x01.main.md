## Matrix Capsules with EM Routing - Implementation

The core functions are implemented in 

```
/src/capsule/core.py
```

+ The initialization operation to connect a regular layer to a matrix capsule layer`capsule_init()`

+ The convolution operation between matrix capsule layer`capsule_conv()`
 
+ The fully-connected operation with shared view transformation weight matrix between matrix capsule layer `capsule_fc()`

+ The EM routing algorithm `matrix_capsules_em_routing()`

The network and loss functions are implemented in

```
/src/capsule/nets.py
```
