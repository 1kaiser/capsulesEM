## Matrix Capsules with EM Routing - Implementation

### Matrix Capsules Layers

The core functions are implemented in 

```
/src/capsules/core.py
```

- The initialization operation to connect a regular layer to a matrix capsule layer`capsules_init()`

    This function constructs a matrix capsule layer (e.g., primaryCaps) from a regular layer.

- The convolution operation between matrix capsule layer`capsules_conv()`

    This function constructs a matrix capsule layer (e.g., ConvCaps1, ConvCaps2) from a matrix capsule layer (e.g., primaryCaps, ConvCaps1).
 
- The fully-connected operation with shared view transformation weight matrix between matrix capsule layer `capsules_fc()`

    This function constructs an output matrix capsule layer with poses and activations (e.g., Class Capsules) from a matrix capsule layer (ConvCaps2). 

- The EM routing algorithm `matrix_capsules_em_routing()`

    This function implements the matrix capsules EM routing algorithm.

### Matrix Capsules Nets

The network and loss functions are implemented in

```
/src/capsule/nets.py
```

Check out the source code for detailed documentation.

### TODO:

- add examples

- doc should be generated from code.
